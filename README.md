♕ N-Queens Logic Puzzle (6 Regions)

A simple Java Swing logic puzzle inspired by the LinkedIn Queens game.
This project is a fun take on the classic N-Queens problem, where the chessboard is divided into 6 randomly generated color regions, and each region can hold only one queen.

This was built just for fun and learning, to explore constraint-based logic, recursion, and GUI programming in Java.

🎯 Puzzle Rules

The game is played on an 8×8 board with 6 colored regions.

To solve the puzzle:

Place exactly one queen in each colored region

Queens must not attack each other

No two queens can share the same row

No two queens can share the same column

No two queens can share the same diagonal

Only one queen per color region

Every generated board is guaranteed to be solvable.
